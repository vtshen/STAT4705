### Part 1

(4 choose 2)

- Q1
  - Derive the mean and variance of the continuous uniform distribution shown in the slide.
- Q2
  - What is the density function of the 1-dim normal distribution N($\mu$, $\sigma^2$)? What is the support of x? 
- Q3
  - Derive the expectation and variance of the distribution of the transformation, z = (x - mu)/sigma, where x ~ N(mu, sigma^2). What is the density function of the transformed variable Z?
- Q4
  - the distribution of transformation:
  1. If you have two random variables Z and V, what properties do these random variable have so that you can use them to construct a new variable, called T, which is t distributed? Write out the  construction formula of T as well (not the density function of T, which is too complicated for now).

### Part 2
In you vt gmail account, go to the shared google sheet, find your name, answer the question in the header of the 2nd column, and type ____ in the column next to the name. Please just type the answer for yourself.

### Feedback on Quiz 2

The grading on the quiz 2 is really strict and hard, only 9 out of 36 was given the bonus. You will get the bonus credit 0.5 only if you:

- 1. signed the google sheet
- 2. answered both questions correctly

If you did not receive the bonus credit, probably because part of the answer was not correct. Please refer to the solutions in the folder Quiz_sols. Also we could talk about it after class. I made mistakes in posting grades before.

However, as long as you signed the google sheet, you have other chances to earn the bonus credit 0.5. Do the Q2 and Q3, and turn in the paper after class before Nov 15. If you answered both Q2 and Q3 correctly, you will earn the bonus credit; if not, probably you have to give it one more try.


## Quiz 3 on Nov 8

### Part 1

(8 choose 1)

- Q5
  - the distribution of transformation:
  1. If you have two random variables U and V, what properties do these random variables have so that you can use them to construct a new variable, called F, which is F distributed? Write out the formula of F, too. (not the density function of F, which is too complicated for now)
- Q6
  - Consider an experiment where the random variable X is the number of trials before the first success, what is the distribution of the random variable X? Write out the pmf of X. Is this distribution similar to the binomial distribution in terms of pmf? What is the similarity and what is the difference? 
- Q7
  - Part 1. Suppose there are n random variables, x1, x2, ..., xn, which are i.i.d. poisson distrinution Po(\lambda). Then what is the distribution of the sum, x1 + x2 + x3 + ... + xn?
  - Part 2. Suppose # of births in a time period follows a poisson distribution with the rate parameter lambda. If we know in hospital A the birth rate is 2.3 in two-hours interval, then what is the birth rate in the thirty-minutes interval? 
- Q8
  - Assume that the distributon of blood types in the US is: 4 Types O, A, B, AB, and the respective probabilities are 0.44, 0.42, 0.10, 0.04. In a random sample of 10 Americans, what is the probability that 6 have O, 2 have A, 1 has B, and 1 has AB? (Formula only, no calculations needed) What is the probability that 6 have A and 4 have others? (Formula only, no calculations needed)


### Part 2
In you vt gmail account, go to the shared google sheet, find your name, answer the question in the header of the 2nd column, and type ____ in the column next to the name. Please just type the answer for yourself.

### Part 1

(9 choose 1)

- Q9

	- To see the spread and the median of data sets: 25,-10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, please draw the (modified) boxplot (including outliers).

Concepts maybe needed:

- median, aka the second quantile: the middle of sorted numbers.
- the first quantile Q1: The 25th percentile
- the third quantile Q3: The 75th percentile
- IQR: The interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between the first and third quartiles.
- the lower fence: Q1 - 1.5(IQR)
- the upper fence: Q3 + 1.5(IQR)
- Suspected outliers: either 1.5×IQR or more above the third quartile or 1.5×IQR or more below the first quartile.
- outliers: either 3×IQR or more above the third quartile or 3×IQR or more below the first quartile.

Note: the whiskers extend to the most extreme data point which is no more than 1.5 times the interquartile range from the box. 

### Part 2
In you vt gmail account, go to the shared google sheet, find your name, answer the question in the header of the 2nd column, and type ____ in the column next to the name. Please just type the answer for yourself.
