### Part 1

(4 choose 2)

- Q1
  - Derive the mean and variance of the continuous uniform distribution shown in the slide.
- Q2
  - What is the density function of the 1-dim normal distribution N($\mu$, $\sigma^2$)? What is the support of x? 
- Q3
  - Derive the expectation and variance of the distribution of the transformation, z = (x - mu)/sigma, where x ~ N(mu, sigma^2). What is the density function of the transformed variable Z?
- Q4
  - the distribution of transformation:
  1. If you have two random variables Z and V, what properties do these random variable have so that you can use them to construct a new variable, called T, which is t distributed? Write out the  formula of T, too.
  2. If you have two random variables U and V, what properties do these random variables have so that you can use them to construct a new variable, called F, which is F distributed? Write out the formula of F, too.
