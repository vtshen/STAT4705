### Part 1

(4 choose 2)

- Q1
  - Derive the mean and variance of the continuous uniform distribution shown in the slide.
- Q2
  - What is the density function of the 1-dim normal distribution N($\mu$, $\sigma^2$)? What is the support of x? 
- Q3
  - Derive the expectation and variance of the distribution of the transformation, z = (x - mu)/sigma, where x ~ N(mu, sigma^2). What is the density function of the transformed variable Z?
- Q4
  - the distribution of transformation:
  1. If you have two random variables Z and V, what properties do these random variable have so that you can use them to construct a new variable, called T, which is t distributed? Write out the  construction formula of T as well (not the density function of T, which is too complicated for now).

### Part 2
In you vt gmail account, go to the shared google sheet, find your name, answer the question in the header of the 2nd column, and type ____ in the column next to the name. Please just type the answer for yourself.

### Feedback on Quiz 2

The grading on the quiz 2 is really strict and hard, only 9 out of 36 was given the bonus. You will get the bonus credit 0.5 only if you:

- 1. signed the google sheet
- 2. answered both questions correctly

If you did not receive the bonus credit, probably because part of the answer was not correct. Please refer to the solutions in the folder Quiz_sols. Also we could talk about it after class. I made mistakes in posting grades before.

However, as long as you signed the google sheet, you have other chances to earn the bonus credit 0.5. Do the Q2 and Q3, and turn in the paper after class before Nov 8. If you answered both Q2 and Q3 correctly, you will earn the bonus credit; if not, probably you have to give it one more try.


## Quiz 3 on Nov 8

### Part 1

(8 choose 2)

- Q5
  - the distribution of transformation:
  1. If you have two random variables U and V, what properties do these random variables have so that you can use them to construct a new variable, called F, which is F distributed? Write out the formula of F, too.
- Q6
- Q7
- Q8

### Part 2
In you vt gmail account, go to the shared google sheet, find your name, answer the question in the header of the 2nd column, and type ____ in the column next to the name. Please just type the answer for yourself.
